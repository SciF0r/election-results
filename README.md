Election Results
================

Disclaimer
----------

This is Quick&Dirty hack to show the election results of the national elections
in the Canton of Bern. Feel free to use this code or send pull requests. In
order to extend this project to more cantons, some refactoring is required. The
HTML part would need some improvements, too.

Usage
-----

- Install python 3
- (Optionally create and activate a virtualenv)
- pip install beautifulsoup4 jinja2
- ./collect.py

There will be one html file for each list in the directory output (1.html,
2.html, ...).
